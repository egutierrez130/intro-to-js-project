/* Primitive JavaScript Data Types

1. Number: Floating point numbers, for decimals and integers
2. String: Sequence of characters, used for text
3. Boolean: Logical data type that can only be true or false
4. Undefined: Data type of a variable that does not have a value yet.
5. Null: Also means 'non-existant'

JavaScript has dynamic typing: data types are automatically assigned to variables
